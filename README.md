# selenium-pyautogui-web-automation

I am doing this project as a part of my internship at Samsung R&D Institute, Delhi. This project specifically aims at automating features like downloading files and sending emails with attachments without the use of smtplib.

Libraries and modules that I have used are: Selenium, Helium and pyautogui.
